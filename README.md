For my Quiz project, I've built both the backend and frontend. The backend includes categories, questions, and difficulty levels, while the frontend consists of a Home Page, Players Detail Page, Category Page, Question Page, and Result Page. To start the backend, the command is `npm start`. For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm start`. Both the frontend and backend are live at this deployed link: https://beautiful-macaron-1cf1e0.netlify.app/
